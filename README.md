# Arduino metal pinpointer

## Intro
This is my first project working with microcontrollers. I will be utilising an Ardunio and ATTiny85 chip in order to produce a "smart" metal detector (pinpointer).
My work will be based upon the [YFM2 by El Yeti.](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/YFM2_pinpointer_detector_de_metales.html)
