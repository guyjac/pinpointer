# Arduino metal detector (pinpointer) üíç 

This is my first project working with microcontrollers. I will be utilising an Ardunio and ATTiny85 chip in order to produce a "smart" metal detector (pinpointer).
My work will be based upon the [YFM2 by El Yeti.](https://yeti-lab.blogspot.com/2020/10/esta-la-nueva-version-del-pinpointer-yfm.html)

I will be programming the ATTiny85 using a C type language.



## Requirements
- Arduino 
- ATTiny85
- All parts on the current project should be SMD/SMT (printed by the manufacturer)
